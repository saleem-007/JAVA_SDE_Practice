we can store heterogenous type of data
It is not indexed type of collections
It allows duplicates
It doesn't allow null
It is auto sorted
Since it is not a indexed type of collection we can not fetch the elements upon
index and hence we use poll() and peek()
poll()- it is a non-static method of propriety queue class which will fetch the
top most element of the queue and reduce the size of the queue by 1
peek()- it is a non-static method of propriety queue class it will fetch the top
most element of the queue and it will not reduce size of the queue by one
